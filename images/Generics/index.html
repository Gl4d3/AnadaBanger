                <img class= "image1" src="/images/pexels-svetlana-b-3913295.jpg">Give me a reason to hurt me
                I'm so good at lying
                'Bout why I'm alone
                Like math class, I'm problematic
                No equations to stay in balance
                I'm half okay, and like half insane
                And you're half the same so we laugh at pain
                I'm stressed out and you are too
                On a roll like R2, you went D2 for that one sport
                Still pressing me on that full court
                Shot my shot when I had to
                And they tried to block, but it passed through
                I got in the zone like that defense that you tried to use
                When I asked if you're okay, you said no way
                Like just stop the music, just stop the songs
                You ain't care at all when you dropped the ball
                So don't try to talk when I'm gone</p>
                <p>Give me a reason for searching
                I miss you, I'm trying
                Wish you would come home
                Ay, I know our house ain't perfect, it ain't ever been
                All these sticky situations somehow we keep steppin' in
                Pushing signs to the side, bring up what's irrelevant
                I've learned a lot on patience so
                Now maybe we could settle this
                Every time, same old thing
                Gotta watch out, your kisses sting
                Calm and cool, no walking out
                Tryna speak with love, and not put you down
                And this time, you'll fall back into my arms again
                And this time, keep you safe where your heart is meant
                Give me a reason to hurt me
                I'm so good at lying
                'Bout why I'm alone
                Give me a reason for searching
                I miss you, I'm trying
                Wish you would come home</p>
